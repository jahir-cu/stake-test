## About Stake-test-app

Stake - The modern way for anyone to invest in real estate:

- Simple, fast croud funding platform.
- Retrieve large number of properties.
- Invest in prime rental properties on MENAâ€™s leading real estate investment platform, from only AED 500.

## Technology used
- `Laravel version 9` for the application.
- `Laravel sail` a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment.
- `Laravel Sanctum` provides a featherweight authentication system for      token based APIs.

## Installation

> **Note:** Require the `Docker Desktop` installed on your computer. File sharing sould be turned on for the application root path from `preference->resources->file sharing`

```sh
Clone repo
cd stake-test
Composer install
```
After the vendor folder has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:
```sh
./vendor/bin/sail up
```
Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser or postman app at: http://localhost/api/v1.

However, instead of repeatedly typing vendor/bin/sail to execute Sail commands, you may wish to configure a shell alias that allows you to execute Sail's commands more easily:
```sh
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'
```
Once the shell alias has been configured, you may execute Sail commands by simply typing sail. for eg

```sh
sail up
sail php artisan migrate
...
```
- Migration

The `migrate:fresh` with `seed` command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate  and seed command:

```sh
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
> **Note:** If any connection refuced issue happen, you need to run `docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} - {{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' $(docker ps -aq)` to get ports which running docker services,update relevent ports info on env
